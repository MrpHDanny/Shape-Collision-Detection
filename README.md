# Shapes-Collision-Game

Task description: </br>

Write a test game program (Game.cpp) that creates several shapes and stores them in a data structure
of your choosing. The program should then iterate through the data, move each shape by a small
random amount (but keeping them within a grid of a given size) and check to see if there are any
shapes overlapping. If there are, it should output the details about the overlapping shapes (you do not
need to deal with the problem of disentangling overlapping shapes - that is a much trickier problem
in game design!). It should then remove the overlapping shapes from the data structure and continue
the game until at most one shape remains. You may decide upon any reasonable course of action if a
shape reaches the edge of your playing surface
